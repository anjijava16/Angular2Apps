        M - Model  (TypeScript Members / JavaScript Variables)

        V - View   (HTML / HTML5 / JADE )

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions /  Type Script Decorators)

    - In Genaral we will prepare Angular2 Applications By using TypeScript.

    - TypeScript is the SuperSet of JavaScript

    - Microsoft Identifies the "Issues / Limitations / Drawbacks" of AngularJS  and Provides the

      Sollutions in the Form of a TypeScript.

    - Angular2 is not the "Advanced Version AngularJS".

    - We Can Run the Angular Applications in the Following Platforms.

            2.Web

            3.Mobile Browser

            4.Mobile OS

                    Android

                    iPhone

    - Angular2 Apps are 5X faster than AngularJS Applications

    - We Can't Run the Angular2 Applications without Proper Environmental Setup.

    - In Genaral we will Run the Angular2 Application by using "lite server"

    - Angular2 Can Interact with the Multiple Technologies like AngularJS,

                                                                reactJS

4.Component

    - Component will tell how "view" should be present.

    - Component Acting as Glue Between View and Model.

    - In Genaral we will prepare Components By using TypeScript.

    - TypeScript Follows OOPS.

    - Angular2 Application May be the More Than One Module.

    - We Can Provide The Communication Between the One Module to Another Module in Angular2 Application.
